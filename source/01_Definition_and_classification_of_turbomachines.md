## Gas cycles and turbomachines

Thermodynamics finds one of its most prominent fields of application in **power generation**. In such applications, energy conversion is achieved by means of systems that operate according to a **thermodynamic cycle**, that is, a process in which the initial and final states of the working fluid coincide. Cycles whose purpose is to deliver a net power output are referred to as **power cycles**.

The devices that operate following a power cycle and deliver useful mechanical power are commonly known as **thermal engines** or simply **engines**. Their classification can be approached from different perspectives, depending on the nature of the working fluid, the way the fluid is handled, and the manner in which heat is supplied during the cycle.

### Classification of power cycles

A first level of classification concerns the **thermodynamic state of the working fluid** during the cycle:

- **Gas cycles:**  
  The working fluid remains in the gaseous state throughout the entire cycle. Typical examples include automobile engines and aircraft engines.

- **Vapor cycles:**  
  The working fluid undergoes phase change during part of the cycle and may exist as a two-phase mixture. Steam cycles employed in thermal and nuclear power plants   belong to this category, as do combined cycles.

A second classification distinguishes cycles according to whether the working fluid is **recirculated** or **renewed**:

- **Closed cycles:**  
  The working fluid is recirculated and returns to its initial thermodynamic state at the end of each cycle. Certain combined cycles used in power plants operate in this manner.

- **Open cycles:**  
  The working fluid is discharged to the surroundings at the end of the process, and fresh fluid is drawn into the system. Although the device operates in a cyclic mechanical fashion, the working fluid does not complete a closed thermodynamic cycle. Automobile and aircraft engines are typical open cycles.

Finally, power cycles can be classified according to the **mode of heat addition**:

- **Internal combustion cycles:**  
  Heat is supplied by fuel combustion occurring within the system boundaries, as in car and aircraft engines.

- **External combustion cycles:**  
  Heat is supplied from an external source, such as a furnace, nuclear reactor, or geothermal source, without direct contact between the fuel and the working fluid.

### Scope of gas cycles

The next part of the course is devoted to **gas cycles**, that is, power cycles in which a mixture of air and fuel is used to generate a net power output, with no phase change occurring during the process.

Several classical gas cycles exist and are traditionally identified by specific names associated with their practical realization. Among them, the most relevant are:

- the **Otto cycle**, representative of spark-ignition (gasoline) engines,
- the **Diesel cycle**, representative of compression-ignition engines.

These cycles, characteristic of internal reciprocating combustion engines, will be addressed in the next lecture.

The present topic focuses instead on the **Brayton cycle**, which forms the basis of both aircraft engines and stationary gas turbines. In these systems, the working fluid flows continuously through rotating devices, undergoing compression, combustion, and expansion. For this reason, Brayton-cycle engines are classified as **turbomachines**, and they constitute **open systems**.

(subsec_turbomachines_intro)=
### Turbomachines

Turbomachines admit several layers of classification. A first distinction is based on the **nature of the working fluid**:

- **Hydraulic turbomachines**, which operate with incompressible fluids (liquids).
  These will not be considered in the present module.

- **Thermal turbomachines**, which operate with compressible fluids (gases).
  These are the focus of the current discussion.

Independently of the working fluid, turbomachines can be classified according to their **energetic role**:

- **Generators:**  
  Devices that increase the energy of the fluid. In thermal turbomachines, this role is fulfilled by **compressors**, which raise the fluid pressure, and by **propellers**, which increase the kinetic energy of the flow.

- **Receivers:**  
  Devices that extract energy from the fluid and produce a net power output. Gas and vapor turbines belong to this category.

In thermal turbomachines, energy extraction may occur through:

- a reduction of **enthalpy**, as in gas and steam turbines,
- a reduction of **kinetic energy**, as in certain aero-turbines.

### Applications of gas-turbine systems

The thermal turbomachines studied in this module are those that provide a **net power output**. Depending on their intended purpose, different configurations are employed:

- **Stationary gas turbines**, whose sole objective is the generation of mechanical and electrical power. These systems are widely used in combined-cycle power plants, large marine propulsion, and heavy-duty industrial applications.

- **Propulsion gas turbines**, whose objective is to increase the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases to generate thrust, as in aircraft engines. Although the underlying gas cycle is the same, different propulsion architectures exist, such as the **turbojet**, **turbofan**, and **turboprop**. Their detailed analysis is deferred until the Brayton cycle has been thoroughly studied.

### Conceptual closure

- Power cycles are thermodynamic cycles designed to produce net mechanical power.
- Gas cycles operate entirely in the gaseous phase of the working fluid.
- Power cycles can be classified by fluid state, fluid renewal, and heat-addition
  mechanism.
- The Brayton cycle underlies gas turbines and aircraft engines.
- Turbomachines are continuous-flow devices that exchange energy with a fluid.
- Gas turbines may be designed for stationary power generation or for propulsion.
