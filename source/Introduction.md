## What is this course about?

This course, **Thermal and Fluids Engineering**, may be viewed in essence as a course on *Applied Thermodynamics*. That is, it takes the broad, conceptual framework of thermodynamics and translates it into a tool for understanding, modeling, and predicting how physical systems behave under change.

Applied thermodynamics does not merely involve formulas or machines — it is a *way of reasoning* about the world.
It asks us to see every phenomenon as part of a wider order governed by a small set of universal principles.
Through it, we learn not just to calculate, but to **interpret**: to recognize the patterns that nature follows when systems evolve, interact, or reach balance.

In this sense, applied thermodynamics stands at the frontier between *general physical theory* and *practical understanding*.
It is “applied” because we use it to describe real systems — but what it applies are the most **universal laws** known in science.
To study applied thermodynamics is, therefore, to study *thermodynamics* itself: the general theory from which all our reasoning about transformation, limitation, and equilibrium derives.

Before we proceed, it is worth pausing to consider some fundamental questions that guide the entire discipline:

* What exactly is **thermodynamics**, in its most general sense?
* Why do its principles seem to govern everything that changes or evolves in nature?
* How does it differ from other branches of physical science, such as mechanics or chemistry?
* What kinds of questions does thermodynamics actually answer — and which ones lie beyond its reach?
* And finally, what makes it so essential to science and to our understanding of the physical world?

The next section begins to answer these questions, by exploring the **nature and scope of thermodynamics** — the framework from which both the applied and theoretical views of the physical world emerge.

(sec_nature_and_scope_of_thermodynamics)=
## The nature and scope of thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is the science of **energy, change, and equilibrium**. It explains how energy can be stored, transferred, and transformed, and it establishes the **limits** that constrain every natural or engineered process. Its laws are empirical but universal — they apply to any physical system, regardless of its composition or scale.

To understand its position among the physical sciences, it is useful to compare it with its closest relatives:

* **Mechanics** studies **motion and force**.
  It asks *how* and *why* bodies move, deform, or remain in equilibrium under the action of forces.
  Its key quantities are **position**, **velocity**, **momentum**, and **force**, and its guiding principle is **Newton’s laws** (or their Lagrangian/Hamiltonian counterparts).

* **Chemistry** studies **composition and transformation**.
  It asks *how matter changes identity*, how atoms rearrange to form molecules, and how energy is exchanged in those transformations.
  It links **microscopic structure** to **macroscopic change** through the notions of **chemical potential**, **reaction enthalpy**, and **equilibrium**.

* **Thermodynamics** studies **energy, transformation, and equilibrium**.
  It asks *what can happen* in the physical world, *how much energy is involved*, *in which direction* processes naturally evolve, and *how efficiently* they can be realized.
  Thermodynamics does not describe trajectories or molecular mechanisms — it sets the **boundaries of the possible**.

:::{admonition} Note: why thermodynamics constrains other disciplines
:class: note, dropdown
Thermodynamics provides the **energetic framework** that mechanics, chemistry or any other discipline must obey.
Every physical process — whether mechanical motion, chemical reaction or any generic transformation whatsoever — must satisfy the same fundamental laws of **energy conservation** and **entropy growth**.
:::

In essence, thermodynamics concerns itself with three questions fundamental to all processes:

1. **Feasibility:** Can the process occur?
2. **Quantity:** How much energy is exchanged or transformed?
3. **Quality:** How effectively can that energy be converted into useful work?

These questions are answered by two foundational principles:

* The **$1^{\text{st}}$ law of Thermodynamics**, which expresses the **conservation of energy**.
* The **$2^{\text{nd}}$ law of Thermodynamics**, which introduces **entropy** and defines the **direction** and **limitations** of natural processes.

Together, they describe not only how much energy changes, but how **useful** that energy remains after transformation.

(sec_why_thermodynamics_matters)=
## Why thermodynamics matters

The relevance of thermodynamics extends far beyond heat and engines.
It underpins all phenomena involving **energy flow**, from the microscopic scale of molecular interactions to the grand scale of planetary and cosmic evolution.

Its importance arises from two complementary characteristics:

1. **Universality** — the laws of thermodynamics apply to *all* systems, independently of their material makeup or complexity.
2. **Predictive power** — once these laws are accepted, they allow us to determine whether a proposed process or device is **possible**, **efficient**, or **impossible**.

Thermodynamics enables engineers and scientists to:

* Determine the **feasibility** of physical or chemical processes.
* Quantify **heat**, **work**, and **energy** exchanges.
* Identify the **direction** of spontaneous change (the arrow of time).
* Evaluate the **efficiency** and **irreversibility** of machines and cycles.
* Define **performance limits** that no technology can surpass.
* Understand the **energetic cost** of order, organization, and life itself.

In practice, these principles are indispensable for:

* **Power generation:** analyzing engines, turbines, and power plants.
* **Refrigeration and air conditioning:** evaluating cooling and heat-pump cycles.
* **Environmental and energy systems:** assessing efficiency and sustainability.
* **Material processing:** studying heating, melting, or chemical reactions.
* **Aerospace and fluid mechanics:** understanding energy exchange in motion.

:::{admonition} Important: what thermodynamics imposes
:class: important
Thermodynamics tells us not how the world moves, but how far it *can* move.
It defines the boundaries of possibility for every process in nature — physical, chemical, biological, or technological.

(sec_purpose_of_studying_thermodynamics)=
## The purpose of studying thermodynamics

To study thermodynamics is to learn how to **think in terms of energy** rather than mechanisms.
It teaches us to step back from specific forces or materials and focus on the **balance**, **transformation**, and **degradation** of energy itself.

Through this perspective, we develop the ability to:

* Recognize **feasible** versus **impossible** processes.
* Quantify the **energetic cost** of change.
* Identify where and why **losses** occur in real systems.
* Evaluate **performance** and **efficiency** relative to ideal limits.
* See how **all systems**, natural or engineered, are bound by the same physical principles.

This approach is essential for modern engineering, where every design — from a small battery to a massive power plant — must balance performance, sustainability, and fundamental physical constraints.

:::{admonition} Important: how thermodynamics shapes our reasoning
:class: important
To master thermodynamics is to understand the laws that no system in the universe can escape.
It reveals the cost of change, the limits of efficiency, and the reason why perfection — complete reversibility — is impossible.
:::

:::{admonition} Note: a broader view — thermodynamics as a hierarchical and universal framework
:class: note, dropdown

Thermodynamics exists at multiple levels of abstraction, each building upon the same fundamental principles but addressing different questions and scales.
This hierarchy reveals the richness and universality of the theory.

(subsec_engineering_and_applied_thermodynamics)=
### Engineering and applied thermodynamics

This is the **practical** domain where thermodynamic principles are used to analyze and design real systems.
It treats matter as continuous and focuses on macroscopic quantities — pressure, temperature, enthalpy, entropy, and efficiency.
It provides the basis for mechanical, chemical, and environmental engineering, where energy conversion and utilization are the core concerns.

(subsec_classical_thermodynamics)=
### Classical (macroscopic) thermodynamics

The **axiomatic** form of thermodynamics, built upon postulates and measurable properties.
It defines **state functions** ($U$, $H$, $S$, etc.), classifies processes as **reversible** or **irreversible**, and describes equilibrium as the most stable state of an isolated system.
It does not rely on molecular detail — it is a phenomenological science, dealing directly with observable quantities.

(subsec_statistical_thermodynamics)=
### Statistical thermodynamics

The **microscopic foundation** of thermodynamics.
It connects macroscopic laws to the statistical behavior of molecules.
Entropy becomes a measure of **probability**, expressed as $S{}={}k_B{}\ln{}\Omega$.
Here, the $2^{\text{nd}}$ law arises naturally as systems evolve toward the **most probable distribution** of energy states.
This level explains *why* the macroscopic laws hold true.

(subsec_quantum_thermodynamics)=
### Quantum thermodynamics

At the quantum scale, thermodynamics merges with quantum mechanics.
Energy exchange becomes quantized, and phenomena such as coherence and entanglement modify how we interpret heat, work, and entropy.
This domain explores **quantum engines**, **microscopic refrigerators**, and the relationship between **information and energy**.
Even here, the same two laws persist: energy is conserved, and entropy never decreases.

(subsec_a_universal_framework)=
### A universal framework

Across all these levels, the message remains the same:

* The **$1^{\text{st}}$ law** enforces energy conservation.
* The **$2^{\text{nd}}$ law** introduces direction, irreversibility, and entropy.
* The combination of both defines **exergy**, the measure of how much energy can be usefully converted into work.

Thermodynamics is therefore not just a discipline — it is a **meta-theory** of nature.
It provides the coherent structure within which all other physical sciences, from mechanics to cosmology, must fit.
Every process, regardless of its complexity or scale, obeys these principles.
